# Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) - Simple Overview

## What is MLP?

A **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)** is a type of artificial neural network commonly used in machine learning and deep learning tasks. It's designed to process complex data by passing inputs through multiple layers of neurons and making predictions based on learned patterns.

### Key Components:

1. **Input Layer**: Receives the input data (e.g., numbers or images).
2. **Hidden Layers**: These layers transform the input data into useful patterns using weights and activation functions.
3. **Output Layer**: Produces the final result or prediction based on the learned patterns.

### Why Use MLP?

- Can handle **non-linear data**.
- Works for tasks like **classification**, **regression**, and **pattern recognition**.
- Learns complex patterns through multiple layers and adjusts weights with a process called **backpropagation**.

### How MLP Works:

1. **Data Input**: Information is fed into the input layer.
2. **Forward Propagation**: The data is passed through hidden layers where weights and biases are applied, and activation functions transform the data.
3. **Prediction**: The output layer gives the prediction or result.
4. **Error Correction**: Using backpropagation, the MLP adjusts its weights based on the error in predictions.

### Activation Functions:
- **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)**: Helps introduce non-linearity and handles complex data.
- **Sigmoid** and **Tanh**: Other popular activation functions that help in decision-making.

In summary, MLP is a powerful tool for solving more complex tasks like classification, regression, and even recognizing images.

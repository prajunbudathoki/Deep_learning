# Early Stopping in Deep Learning

Early stopping is a technique used in training neural networks to prevent overfitting. Overfitting happens when a model learns too much detail from the training data, making it perform well on that data but poorly on new data. Early stopping helps stop training at the point where the model works best on new, unseen data.

## Why Use Early Stopping?
When training a neural network, the model's accuracy on the training data improves with each epoch (training round). However, after a certain point, its performance on new data can start to drop. Early stopping allows us to stop training at the optimal point, just before the model begins to overfit.

## How Early Stopping Works
1. **Monitor Validation Loss**: During training, we measure how well the model performs on validation data (data not seen by the model in training).
2. **Set Patience**: Define a patience value, which is the number of epochs to wait for an improvement in validation performance.
3. **Stop Training**: If the model does not improve within the set patience, stop the training to avoid overfitting.

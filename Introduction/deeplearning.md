# Introduction to Deep Learning

**Deep Learning** is a subset of machine learning that focuses on algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called **neural networks**. Unlike traditional machine learning techniques that require manual feature extraction, deep learning models automatically learn to identify patterns in large amounts of data. This ability makes deep learning particularly effective for tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

## Key Concepts of Deep Learning
- **Neural Networks**: Composed of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process and learn from data.
- **Layers**: 
  - **Input Layer**: Receives the raw data.
  - **Hidden Layers**: Intermediate layers that perform transformations on the input.
  - **Output Layer**: Produces the final prediction or output.
- **Activation Functions**: Functions applied to the output of each neuron to introduce non-linearity, allowing the model to learn complex patterns.

## Types of Neural Networks

1. **Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN)**
2. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**
3. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**
4. **Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM)**
5. **Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)**
6. **Autoencoders**
